1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Image Based Data
	- Feature Data 
IMage Data
===========

3. Image  processing 
	
	- Using opencv, Pillow 
		- Resizing the image
		- creating the square background image
		- Transforming the image using tensor
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image 

4. Data Extraction to train and test set
5. Model building
	
    		- ANN
    		- Decision Tree
    		- Voting Classifier
		- CNN
		- Xception

5. Training the model
6. Building the model 

Feature Data
=============

7. Data processing
	- pandas dataframe
	- Dropping unwanted column
	- Data Normalization
8. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
9. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
10. Feature Extraction and Selection 
7. Splitting the data to train and test 
8. Building the model

    
	- ANN
	- DNN
	- Decision Tree
	- Voting
    - CNN

9. Training and Building the model

Flask Framework
----------------

 
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User Upload an image for analysis and along Feature Data
10. The given input is preprocessed based on inputs provideed
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result for the inputs respectively
12. Final Outcome is display 


Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the ANN and CNN for classification Jaundice using Image and Feature Data,
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such as DecisionTree, Voting Classifier and Xception Classification, for Image Data
and Decision Tree and Voting Classifier for Feature Data,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
